                I was abandoned on a seat on the IRT #1 train inside of a black backpack. 
                The train was halted and the conductor informed of a
                suspicious package.  They cautiously lifted open the backpack and found me amid 
                a slew of restaurant kitchen towels which had the fresh imprints of all of my siblings.
                I was then rescued by a passenger who snuck me into her office inside an UGG sheepskin
                hat and eventually...home with her.
